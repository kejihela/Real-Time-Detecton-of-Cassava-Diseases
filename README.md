# Real-Time-Detecton-of-Cassava-Diseases

## Overview
Root vegetables like cassava are popular in many nations all over the world. It offers a variety of essential nutrients, including resistant starch, which may be good for your health. However, as with any foods, you should be careful to only eat it occasionally. This is especially true in light of the fact that it has a high calorie content and may include hazardous substances.
1. Cassava is know for its diseases which include:
2. Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)
3. Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
4. Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)
5. Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)

These diseases affect the growth and development of the said crop there by affecting the yearly productivity. However, it is important to be able to detect this diseases at earlier stage in other to curb any adverse effect it could cause in terms of produce, cost and economical development. Hence, the design and development of a machine learnig algorithm which is capable to detect the diseases in cassava plants.

## Machine Learning
A subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science called machine learning focuses on using data and algorithms to simulate how humans learn, gradually increasing the accuracy of the system.
